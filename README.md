# Paddlers

An MMORTS game (massively multiplayer online real-time strategy) with a peaceful-looking theme around ducks and religions.

## Technology

The main developing language across the board is Rust and the frontend compiles to [WebAssmebly](https://webassembly.org/) 


##  Roadmap

The project is in an early stage and the team currently consists of a single person spending some hobby-time into this project.

If everything goes to plan, an alpha version will go **live on the 26th of December** with a first test-run to receive feedback from players (alpha-testers).

Hopefully, a link to a live-demo of the deployed master branch will be available here soon.

## Blog

Some of the game development process is documented in this blog series:

- [Gamedev #0: Creating a new universe](https://www.jakobmeier.ch/blogging/Paddlers_0.html)
- [Gamedev #1: Game mechanics](https://www.jakobmeier.ch/blogging/Paddlers_1.html)


## Compiling and running the project (or even contributing)

I don't expect many people to find this project. Therefore, I will save the time and not provide too much information here.

If you are here nevertheless and you are curious enough that you want to clone the repository and run it, I advise you to get in contact with me first. (Open an issue are send me a casual mail at inbox@jakobmeier.ch)

To have the entire micro-service architecture work on a local machine, a few set-up steps are required and these are subject to change on a daily basis.
But don't pushed away by this! I am a friendly person and everyone is welcome to use my code or parts of my code, so I will help if anyone contacts me.
